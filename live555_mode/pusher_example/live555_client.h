// If you're streaming just a single stream (i.e., just from a single URL, once), then you can define and use just a single
// "StreamClientState" structure, as a global variable in your application.  However, because - in this demo application - we're
// showing how to play multiple streams, concurrently, we can't do that.  Instead, we have to have a separate "StreamClientState"
// structure for each "RTSPClient".  To do this, we subclass "RTSPClient", and add a "StreamClientState" field to the subclass:
  // If you choose to continue the application past this point (i.e., if you comment out the "return 0;" statement above),
  // and if you don't intend to do anything more with the "TaskScheduler" and "UsageEnvironment" objects,
  // then you can also reclaim the (small) memory used by these objects by uncommenting the following code:
  /*
    env->reclaim(); env = NULL;
    delete scheduler; scheduler = NULL;
